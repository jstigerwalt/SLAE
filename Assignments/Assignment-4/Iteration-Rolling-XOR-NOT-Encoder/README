Perl Iteration Encoder:

Change Key and Iteration values to get differnt differnt decoder stubs, script will generate decoder stub plus shellcode included.
If something isnt working submit an issue and I will check it out. 


Perl Decoder:

Just there for your reference on how it works. Encoder script covers the decoder stub, just copy and paste into shellcode.c
GCC the C file and run the shellcode. 

Shellcode.c file:

Copy and paste from Perl Encoder to shellcode.c file, it works, super easy and simple. 


Tested on Kali Linux x86 Only. 

Does not check for bad chars, future enchancement you could say.

Shellcode does not increase in size per iteration, stays the same over 1000 iterations. 

Maybe sleeep function or halt could be used per iteration to time out a sandbox, maybe. Dont have to worry about size of shellcode
it never changes.
