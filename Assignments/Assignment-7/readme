GCC Usage:  gcc decrypter-two-fish.c -lmcrypt -ldl -o decrypter
*
Important Arguments:
*
*           -lmcrypt
*           -ldl
*

The 2 arguments must be used to pull in the mcrypt encryption/decryption modules or errors will happen when you compile with GCC.

Encrypter is using Two-Fish encryption and CFB Feedback cipher block which is basically CBC only in reverse.

CFB Feedback Info:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_Feedback_(CFB)


The shellcode used in the crypters is the encoding shellcode stub which uses the Exceve shellcode. This is from Assignemnt #4.
